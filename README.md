# Tableau Sales & Customer Dashboard Project
This project presents two interactive dashboards designed to provide sales managers, executives, and marketing teams with valuable insights into sales performance and customer behaviors.

## Thought Process Behind the Dashboard Design
The goal of creating this dashboard was to provide a user-friendly, visually engaging tool for sales managers, executives, and marketing teams to make data-driven decisions. I wanted to ensure that the dashboards would present both high-level overviews and detailed breakdowns, allowing stakeholders to quickly grasp the most important trends while also giving them the flexibility to dive deeper into specific metrics.

## Sales Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard offers an in-depth look at key sales metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to:

* Analyze year-over-year sales performance with a detailed comparison of total sales, profits, and quantities.
* Visualize monthly sales trends, highlighting the months with the highest and lowest sales.
* Compare product subcategory performance with a focus on sales and profits.
* Track weekly sales and profits, with indicators for performance above or below the average.

## Customer Dashboard
The Customer Dashboard focuses on customer segmentation and behavior, helping teams:

* Understand customer trends, including monthly performance and total orders.
* Analyze customer distribution by the number of orders to gain insights into loyalty and engagement.
* Identify the top 10 customers by profit, with detailed information on sales, profits, and order history.

## Features:
* Interactive charts and graphs for filtering data by product category, subcategory, region, state, and city.
* Year selection for analyzing historical data.
* Seamless navigation between the dashboards.
